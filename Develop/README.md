## Tests
To run the tests for this application, first ensure that you have all dependencies installed by running.Type `npm install` on terminal.
 
Then, you can run the tests using: Type `npm test` on terminal at index.js.
 
This will run a series of tests that verify the functionality of the application, including:
* Testing that the application prompts the user for all necessary input fields
* Testing that the generated README file includes all necessary sections and content
* Testing that the application gracefully handles errors and invalid input

Please note that these tests are not comprehensive and may not cover all possible scenarios. Feel free to add more tests as needed to ensure proper code coverage.

If you'd like to run the application in interactive mode to manually test its functionality, you can do so using: Type `node index.js` on terminal at index.js.

This will launch the application and prompt you for the necessary input fields, allowing you to see the generated README file output.
